### [Function Types](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/creating-the-correct-function-for-the-job-9e15069dcca3)
* Function declarations — a great fit for class methods, not so good as functions
* Function expressions— work well as methods for literal objects, not so great for class methods
* Arrow functions — nice, when you need to have the parent scope while passing the function around, but not a great fit as any type of method
