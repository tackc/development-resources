# Benjamin Hardy Resources

## Journaling

* Be the historian of your life
  * Bullet form - 3-5 bullets per day
    * Events that happened throughout the day
    * Key progress made on something
    * Key insights learned
    * Challenges overcame
* Your written statement should be in present-tense, as though you already have you what seek. For example, “I am making over $100,000,” or “I have an amazing relationship with my life and kids.”



  ### Before Bed
    * Take a few moments before you go to bed to meditate on and write down the things you’re trying to accomplish. 
    * The more specific the questions, the more clear will be your answers. While you’re sleeping, your subconscious mind will get to work on those things. 
      - Account to yourself what you got done that day and what needs to be moved to tomorrow. 
      - Write the things you learned and experienced.
      - Direct your subconscious by writing about things you want to focus on tomorrow.
    * Questions to Ask:
      * *What creative outlet do you need to engage in to fill your soul and move your dreams forward?*
      * *What spiritual experiences do you need to engage in to deepen your connection to yourself and God?*
      * *What conversations do you need to have to move mountains in your career and self-improvement?*
      * *What experiences do you want to create with your loved ones to deepen those relationships and ensure they are your greatest asset and joy?*

  ### Morning Routine

    * Rise Early — ideally at or before 5AM.
    * Super-hydrate — 20+ ounces of water immediately upon waking up.
    * Connection — through prayer and meditation, you want to seek connection to yourself and God.
    * Visualization and emotion — you want to imagine your ideal future and you want to generate the emotions you will experience in that future. You also want to generate and fully experience gratitude for future events before they happen in order to trigger your brain and body to anticipate these future events. You attract what you are.
    * Novelty and nutrition — the two things your brain needs to be optimal and remain young.
    * Creativity — you need to put first things first, which means you do your most creative and important work first thing in the morning. If you don’t, you’ll never know what true productivity means.
    * Courage — every day, you need to do something different and outside your current comfort zone. Courage is the starting point of all growth and evolution. It takes courage to embrace the uncertainties of unpredictable outcomes and new behaviors.
