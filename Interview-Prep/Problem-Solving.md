# Problem Solving

Many of these strategies are adapted from George Polya's book *How to Solve It* 

### Steps for solving problems
1. Understand the Problems

    1. Can I restate the problem in my own words
    2. What inputs go into the problem
    3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution
    4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs
    5. How should I label important pieces of data (variable names and such)

2. Explore Concrete Examples

    1. Write down 2-3 simple examples
    2. Progress to more complex examples
    3. Explore examples with empty inputs
    4. Explore examples with invalid inputs

3. Break It Down
4. Solve / Simplify
5. Look Back and Refactor
